Iterator Pattern
'Iterator' is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse
elements of a collection without exposing its underlying represen-
tation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

The main idea of the 'Iterator' pattern is to extract the traversal
behavior of a collection into a separate object called an 'iterator'.
An 'Iterator' object encapsulates all of the traversal details, such
as the current position and how many elements are left till the end.
Because of this, several 'Iterators' can go through the same collection
at the same time, independently of each other.
