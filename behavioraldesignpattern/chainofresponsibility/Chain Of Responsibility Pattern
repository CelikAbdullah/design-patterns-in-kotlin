Chain of Responsibility

'Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets
you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request,
each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to
the next handler in the chain.

The pattern suggests that you link the handlers into a chain. Each linked
handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain.
In addition to processing a request, handlers pass the request further along
the chain. The request travels along the chain until all handlers have had
a chance to process it.
Best part: A handler can decide not to pass the request further down the chain
and effectively stop any further processing.
