Strategy Pattern

Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms,
put each of them into a separate class and make their objects interchangeable.

The Strategy pattern suggests that you take a class that does something specific in a
lot of different ways & extract all of these algorithms into separate classes called
'strategies'.
