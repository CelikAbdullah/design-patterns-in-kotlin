Mediator Pattern
Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate
only via a mediator object.
The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components
which you want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly
by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components.
As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled
to dozens of their colleagues.
