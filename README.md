# Design Patterns implemented in Kotlin

Hello, 
in this repository I want to provide simple implementations of some design patterns. The implementation of each design pattern is
reduced to a minimum so that the idea of the pattern is clear to reader. I have chosen Kotlin as the programming language but the
classes contain a lot of comments so that they are very easy to understand even if you are not fluent in Kotlin. At the moment the
list of design patterns might not be complete but the repository will grow. 
Here the current list: 
- [Behavioral Design Patterns](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern): 
  1. [Chain Of Responsibility](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/chainofresponsibility)
  2. [Command](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/command)
  3. [Iterator](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/iterator)
  4. [Mediator](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/mediator)
  5. [Memento](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/memento)
  6. [Observer](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/observer)
  7. [State](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/state)
  8. [Strategy](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/strategy)
  9. [Template Method](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/template)
  10. [Visitor](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/behavioraldesignpattern/visitor)

- [Structural Design Patterns](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/structuraldesignpattern): 
  1. [Adapter](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/structuraldesignpattern/adapter)
  2. [Bridge](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/structuraldesignpattern/bridge)
  3. [Composite](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/structuraldesignpattern/composite)
  4. [Decorator](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/design-patterns-in-kotlin/tree/main/structuraldesignpattern/decorator)

- Creational Design Patterns: (COMING SOON :-) ) 

# References 
[Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/): 
For me, the best book written on this topic by far. When I started with programming, this was one 
of the first books I bought and I learned a lot.

[Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.de/Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-Software/dp/0201633612) : Back in the days, during my study years at the university we had a “Software Engineering” course. For that course, this book was recommended. It is a little bit old but nevertheless,it’s a great resource.

[Dive Into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book): I can only encourage you to buy and read this book. After reading it, I decided to start a project where I can refresh all my knowledge about software design patterns. Every design pattern chapter in that book has “Real
world analogy” section describing the pattern applied to a real-world scenario. I can confess that each of those sections was
an inspiration for most of my implementations you can see in this repository.

[Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/): This is the accompanying website of the book “Dive Into Design Patterns” I mentioned above. It has a bunch of code implementations for all design patterns the book contains. If you don’t want to buy the book, then this website is the
correct place to visit.
